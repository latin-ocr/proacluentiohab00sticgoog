persons, Vibius Cappadox, the elder and the younger

three sections of his speech, LX-LXII. The chief

prevalent belief bet'ore alluded to, that Cluentius had

one crime was nominelly charged, other offences might
be brought up, and sometimes operated to insure con-
viction or to increase the punishment cn the original
charge. Cicero, therefore, devotes by far the greater
part of his speech to a discussiones the judicium lania-
