eise question of bribery iu the form of a dilemma. Assumiug
that the court πω bribed at all, Cluentius or Oppianicus
must have bribed it If hs shows that Cluentius was not

guilty, of course he proves that Oppianicus was; but if he

' proves that Oppianicus was guilty, he does oct, as he says,

thereby show that Cluentius was not so, “Si ostendo ab
Oppianico, purgo Habitum? Hethen assume that, having ,

has shown 'that Oppianicus was the guilty party. It was
remarked in a note on IV. 9, that the first two 'points there
laid down were necessary to the argument, as -Cieero could
not prove direetly the inuoceuce of Cluentius; he could
only urge the strength of the case which hs brought into
