1. Exordium, L-HI.

2. The first charge being that Cluentius had bribed
the court on the· trial of Oppianicus, three points are
stated in answer: - lst. That the charges against Oppi-
anicus and the evidence to prove them wore such that
’ he could not have been acquitted. 2d. That the trials ’
ot' Semnander and Fabricius were procedente which
could not have been disregarded. cd. Thetthe court ⁴
was bribed, not by Cluentius, hat waiam him, IV. 9.
'I'he first point is proved by a detailed narration of
the marce ot* Oppianicus, IV. lO-XVII· 49. 'I'he
second is explained by a namative ol the two trials'
⁸ referred to, XVII. 49-XXII. 62. To prove the third
point, itis shown that Oppianicus was the only party
who had any reason to· bribe the court-that Staienus,

’ ono os the jurots, did in lact receive money hom Oppi·

· adicus, which he' was asterwards compelled to restore,

-that tho entry oi this money could be found in the
account-booles of Oppianicus,-¹ and that Staienus voted
for condemnatioo because he thought he would thereby
secure all the money for himself, which he had agreed¹
to distribute among the jurors, XXII. 62 -XXXIL 88.

3. Several cases having been cited by the accuser,

, which, as was claimed, proved the guilt of Cluentius,

Cicero discusses them in order ε -lst The 'ca‘se of O.
Junius, the judex quaestionis at the trial of Oppianicus,
