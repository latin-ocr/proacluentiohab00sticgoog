XXXIII. 89. judea quaestionis. A prator generally pre·

sided at the quaestiones perpetuae. His place was sometimes '

supplied byajudes cammah, bnt the manner of the appoint-
ment is not known Ordinarily a Roman magistrate could
not be prosecuted sor misconduct in office until his term
had expired. Ibe judea quaest. appears to have been a'n ,
exception to this rule. He was also obliged to take an oath
lo carry out tho provisions of the law under which his court
was held, and in this respect differed from a praetor.

, The object ot' this settim is to show that the trial of Iunius ,
was not a regulnr trial, that it was “ruinus slmilis.” Cicero
says, supposing it to be atrial, what vas the charge? The
prevalent opinion was that Iunius was tried for having cor-
ruptly procured the conviction of an innocent man. But if
that were the correct view, he should have been tried under '
the Lex Cornelia ds &coriis et Venefieis. But ashe was bold·
ing court under that law himself, Quinctius the prosecutor
would have bean obliged to vait till he was out ot' office, and
then the populace might have become quiet. Moreover, the
charge „alleged was a very trivial ona The conclusionis
that the prosecutor relied entirely on the popular prejudice
to secure a conviction.

had taken place in B. C. 70, and these epitheto are of course
ironical. The process ol drawing lots for the jury was called
unitim and is,from the number challenged, or any other
rause, the jury was not full, the lots were drawn a seoond
time, which was called subsortitio.
